        Created a dynamic To-Do List application where users can add, update, and delete tasks. This application provides a user-friendly interface and helps in managing daily tasks efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application was built using Python and Flask for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Data is stored locally in an SQLite database, making it easy to track tasks. The project is designed to be simple yet effective, offering basic functionalities like adding new tasks, marking them as complete, and removing them.
    </p>

        The efficiency and usability of the project have been optimized to ensure smooth user experience. The code is available for free on GitHub.
