    <h1>Connect Four Game using Python</h1>

    <p>This project is a Python implementation of the classic Connect Four game, where two players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. The goal is to be the first to connect four of your discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>

    <p>The game is built using Python's Tkinter library, providing a graphical interface for easy playability. The game logic handles player turns, checks for winning conditions, and ensures that the game board updates correctly after each move. The game supports two players and includes features like restarting the game after a win or draw.</p>

    <p>This project is an excellent way to explore Python game development and practice implementing classic board game logic. The full source code is available on GitHub.</p>
