    <h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Python</h1>

        <li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, Tkinter</li>

    </ul>

    <p>This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game created using Python's Tkinter library. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to place three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>

    <p>The game interface is built using Tkinter, providing a clean and interactive experience. The game logic is handled within Python, which checks for win conditions, handles player turns, and updates the game board accordingly. The game also allows players to restart and play multiple rounds.</p>

    <p>This project is an excellent example for beginners looking to get started with Python GUI development and game logic implementation. The source code is available for free on GitHub.</p>
